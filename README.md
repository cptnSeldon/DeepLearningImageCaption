# Automated Image Caption


This project's purpose is to study how (and how accurately) are automated images captions generated.

Jason Brownlee has written a complete tutorial on the matter where he proposes to create such a project from scratch using python and deep learning libraries (as keras for instance). The main idea is to follow this tutorial to grasp the bases through his example program, at first, then check other projects and compare their results.

## _Jason Brownlee_'s tutorial on developping a deep learning photo caption generator from _scratch_

This chapter is a resume of the actual post's content.

1. Datasets (photo + caption)

- use of the Flickr8K dataset, content:
  - 8000 images selected manually
  - great variety of scenes and situations
  - each image has 5 sentence-based description

2. Preparation of the data (photo + text)

- use of a pre-trained model
  - Keras already provides such a model

- internal representation is done before the classification is made !
  - extraction by the model

3. Deep learning model development
4. Model evaluation
5. Caption generation
